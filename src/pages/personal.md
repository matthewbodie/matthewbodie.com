Outside of my professional career, I enjoy spending time with my beautiful wife and two (usually) happy and hilarious children.
<br />

I also read a great deal, including too many insipid social media postings, and I am still trying to get through all of the "classics" purchased over the years (nineteenth century lit is still my favorite); however, much of that pursuit has been tabled, as I work to finish [my PhD](https://sites.wp.odu.edu/englishphd/) in Rhetoric, Discourse & Writing Studies at ODU (Go Monarchs!). In addition to reading the works of others, I also have made some attempts at the creative process myself in the form of [poetry](http://matthewbodie.wordpress.com/2013/02/18/the-minor-character-reprint/) (hey, I didn't say they were *great* attempts).

What's more, I listen to music---and plenty of it---as the constantly streaming Spotify account on my computer might indicate. Beyond just listening, I've been actively involved in performing music as a percussionist since age nine, but I have been on hiatus from any regular jam sessions since parental duties took over years ago. In the meantime, I tinker around with piano and acoustic guitar and can plunk or pluck out enough chords to amble my way through a few pop tunes. That said, I tell my wife that my next career of choice will be rock-star. She laughs, and the kids tell me I'm too old, but hey, stranger things have happened.
