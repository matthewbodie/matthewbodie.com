Pleased to meet you...

I'm Matthew Bodie, currently the Executive Director of Learning Resources at St. Petersburg College, and a seasoned college administrator with 13 years of leadership experience in building and enhancing programs, partnerships, and initiatives centered on student and faculty success.

In my current role, I lead a team of 200 staff, dedicated to learning success, and administer a $6 million budget and an additional $400,00 in grants and endowments. Through my leadership, I advance [high-impact practices](https://www.aacu.org/trending-topics/high-impact) by expanding course-integrated tutoring and library support, peer mentoring, and [study strategy development](https://spcollege.libguides.com/c.php?g=1341515&p=9890395) in first-year programs. Moreover, I work to increase engaged learning practices through promotion and participation in Undergraduate Research Experiences that foster scholarly inquiry and student mentorships from experienced faculty.

My expertise also extends to teaching and developing curriculum. Notably, I designed and coordinated a [Quality Matters](https://www.qualitymatters.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/StandardsfromtheQMHigherEducationRubric.pdf)-approved, first-year Composition course, with a [WID](https://wac.colostate.edu/repository/teaching/intro/wid/) approach, used across more than 100 classes. I also have championed faculty and staff development, including co-chairing the college-wide Critical Thinking Initiative, advancing [Open Educational Resources](https://spcollege.libguides.com/oer/home) (OER) development, teaching writing-across-the-curriculum strategies to pre-service teachers, and [formalizing training and development](https://spcollege.libguides.com/c.php?g=1341515&p=9890400) for professional tutoring and library staff.

Additionally, I've fostered student opportunity, belonging, and success through work with African-American male, Universal Design for Learning, and [Project ONEGOAL](https://spcollege.libguides.com/onegoal) initiatives.

I actively collaborate with many internal and external partners, building strong relationships with teams across the college, as well as with state and regional library consortia, city library leaders, and educational technology vendors.

My philosophy of leadership focuses on [seven Cs](https://matthewbodie.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/bodie-philosophy-of-leadership.pdf): communication, collaboration, creativity, care, character, calculation, and context.
